\desc
The \name program is a \em source code generator \rm that is used to generate
software components from a formal description file.

The input \em file \rm is expected to contain the description of the
services, input and output ports, data types definitions and execution contexts
of a software component, written in the \em dotgen \rm language.

The dotgen specification is first processed by a C preprocessor before it is
parsed by \name and transformed into an abstract syntax tree. The program used
as a C preprocessor can be changed with the \tt CPP \rm environment variable.
\name accepts \tt -I \rm and \tt -D \rm options that are passed inchanged to
the cpp program.

The abstract syntax tree is exported in a format suitable to a
\em generator engine \rm that is in charge of a \em template \rm execution for
actual source code generation. The generator engine provides a scripting
language and a set of procedures for use by templates. The directory where
source code for the generator engine is searched can be changed with the
\tt -s \rm option.

Templates are a set of source files that serve as the basis for source code
generation. Templates source files are interpreted by the generator engine. They
can contain code written in the scripting language provided by the generator
engine, that computes generated output, or regular source code that is appended
directly to the generated code. Intermediate files and scripts are saved in a
temporary directory before they are copied to the final destination
directory. The \tt -T \rm option changes the path of the temporary
directory. The \tt -d \rm option will keep all temporary files instead of
deleting them once the program terminates. This is useful only for template
development and debugging.

The choice of a template depends on the kind of source code that is wanted by
the user. Refer to the documentation of the templates for a description on what
they do. The names of the available templates can be listed with the \tt -l \rm
option. The directory in which templates are looked for can be changed with the
\tt -t \rm option.

The \name program accepts \em general options\rm that affect the general program
behaviour. \name can also pass \em template options \rm to the template. These
options will only affect the template behaviour.

# Arguments are split into categories introduced by '\args name desc'.
# '\arg short long optarg' define a new argument, followed by a one-line
# description, an empty line and a long description.

\args general	General options

\arg I -		dir
     add dir to the list of directories searched for headers

     Add the directory \em dir\rm to the list of directories to be searched
     for included files. The \em dir\rm argument is passed as-is to the \tt
     cpp\rm program via the same \tt -I\rm option.

     When \tt -r\rm option is in effect (either explicitely passed on the
     command line, or configured by default during the build process), an
     implicit \tt -I\rm directive pointing to the directory of the input file
     is appended to the end of the list of searched directories.

\arg D -      	     	macro[=value]
     predefine macro, with given value or 1 by default

     Predefine \em macro\rm, with definition \tt 1\rm or \em value\rm if given,
     in the same way as a \tt #define\rm directive would do it. This option is
     passed as-is to the \tt cpp\rm program.

     If you are invoking genom from the shell, you may have to use the shell
     quoting character to protect shell's special characters such as spaces.

     An implicit macro \tt __GENOM__\rm is always defined and contains the
     version of the genom program. This can be used to divert some lines in
     source files meant to be included by other tools that genom, and that
     contain syntax that genom does not understand.

\arg E -
     stop after preprocessing stage

     Stop after the preprocessing stage, and do not run genom proper. The
     output of \tt cpp\rm is sent to the standard output. genom exits with a
     non-zero status if there are any preprocessing errors, such as a
     non-existent included file.

\arg n parse-only
     stop after parsing stage (check syntax only)

     Stop after the input file parsing stage, and do not invoke any
     template. This is useful to check the syntax of the input file. Any errors
     or warning are reported and genom exits with a non-zero status if there
     are errors.

\arg l list
     list available templates

     Print to the standard output the list of available templates. Each line of
     output contains the name of a template and the genom engine that is uses
     (currently, only Tcl-based templates are supported).

     By default, the standard templates directory is searched, but any \tt
     -t\rm option will be taken into account.

\arg t tmpldir		path
     use path as the templates directory

     Use \em path\rm as the directory containing templates. This can be a colon
     separated list of directories which are search in order.

     This option is useful only for templates not installed in the genom
     standard directories, i.e. \tt share/genom/<version>/templates\rm or
     \tt share/genom/site-templates\rm.

     \em path\rm is searched for files matching \tt dir/*/template.tcl\rm,
     where \tt *\rm is the actual template name.

\arg s sysdir	    	dir
     use dir as the directory for generator system files

     Use \em dir\rm as the directory holding genom engine files. This option
     is useful if non-standard engines are to be used. The default value is \tt
     share/genom/<version>/engines\rm.

     \em dir\rm should contain directories named after the engine name.

\arg T tmpdir	        dir
     use dir as the directory for temporary files

     Use \em dir\rm as the temporary directory holding intermediate files. See
     also the environment variable \tt TMPDIR\rm.

\arg r rename
     always invoke cpp with a .c file linked to input file

     Some \tt cpp\rm programs cannot handle correctly files with a \tt .gen\rm
     extension. This option will make genom call cpp with an input file ending
     in \tt .c\rm, linked to the real input file.

\arg -'r' no-rename
     pass input file directly to cpp (opposite of -r)

     This option is the opposite of \tt -r\rm: it forces genom to invoke \tt
     cpp\rm directly with the \tt .gen\rm input file. This is the default
     behaviour. If you are using GNU cpp, it might be necessary to pass it the
     additional \tt -xc\rm option, to force it to handle the file as C source.

\arg v verbose
     produce verbose output

     Force genom to be more verbose while processing input files.

\arg d debug
     activate debugging options

     Activate some debugging options. In particular, temporary files are not
     deleted. Useful for debugging genom itself or generator engines.

\arg h help
     print usage summary (this text)

     Print usage summary and exit.

# Template specific options
\args template	Template options

\arg h help
     print options specific to template

     Templates might define their own specific options. The \tt -h\rm option is
     always defined, and prints a summary of supported options. See the
     template manual for a detailed description. Template options should be
     passed after the template name, and before the input file name.

# Environment variables
\env CPP
     C preprocessor program

     Define the C preprocessor program to use. The default depends on the value
     configured during the genom build process, but it is most often
     \tt gcc -E -xc\rm on Linux systems.

     The \tt CPP\rmprogram must recognize \tt -I\rm and \tt -D\rm arguments.

\env GENOM_TMPL_PATH
     template search path

     The value of \tt GENOM_TEMPLATE_PATH\rm is a colon-separated list of
     directories, much like \tt PATH\rm, where \name looks for
     templates. Setting this variable overrides the default search path, but
     any \tt -t\rm option takes precedence over this variable.

\env TMPDIR
     directory for temporary files

     Path to the directory holding temporary files. Defaults to \tt /tmp\rm.
