What is missing for 3.0
-----------------------

  Define TCL procedures to add services, parameters, maybe tasks, maybe
  components.

  Create tcl procedure to retrieve a component, service, task, ... by name (or
  pattern, like [dotgen types]).

  Document tcl object procedures

  Write introduction in documentation

  Write component model in documentation

  Write genom overview in documentation

  Write minimal example in documentation

  Document remaining grammar rules in documentation

  Refine C++ mappings for bounded types (extend the genom classes).
  In particular: add operator[] for sequences.

  Improve documentation index
