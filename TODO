What is missing for 3.0
-----------------------

  Simplify parameter that are "members" of the ids. Currently what is returned
  in TCL is a list of integers and strings. Maybe change that to a hierachy of
  types, like for initializers. Maybe add a [language lang member type-list
  var] procedure that converts the member list into a language construct.

  Define TCL procedures to add services, parameters, maybe tasks, maybe
  components.

  Create typed events, and merge with ports. We should have {in|out}port
  {data|event}.

  Create tcl procedure to retrieve a component, service, task, ... by name (or
  pattern, like [dotgen types]).
