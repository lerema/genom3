Component description file
--------------------------

This chapter describes the syntax of the `genom` component description
file. This file has by convention a name ending with the `.gen` suffix. It is
thus often called the `.gen` file (or `dot gen`).

The `dot gen` file contains the complete formal description of a component in
terms of services and data types it provides. Such a description completely
defines the interface and the internals of a component. The syntax of this
files is a mix between a subset of the OMG IDL for data types definitions and
genom specific constructs.

The `dot gen` file is pre-processed by a pre-processor that follows the
standard of the `C` preprocessor. See the
link:preprocessing{outfilesuffix}[Preprocessing] section for details.  The
complete link:grammar{outfilesuffix}[grammar definition] is available for
reference, but the most important constructs are detailed in the following
sections.

The description of the `dot gen` grammar uses a syntax notation that is similar
to `EBNF` (Extended Backus-Naur Format).  The following table lists the symbols
used in this format and their meaning.
