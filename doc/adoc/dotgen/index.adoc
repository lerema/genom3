Input File Format
-----------------

This chapter describes the `genom3` Input File Format (also known as `dotgen`)
and gives the syntax for `dotgen` grammatical constructs. `dotgen` is the
language used to formally describe a `genom3` component in terms of services
and data types it provides.  A description written in `dotgen` completely
defines the interface and the internals of a component.

A description of the `dotgen` preprocessing is presented in
link:preprocessing{outfilesuffix}[Preprocessing].  The complete grammar is
presented in link:grammar{outfilesuffix}[Grammar reference]. Associated
semantics is described in the rest of this chapter either in place or through
references to other sub sections of this chapter.

A source file containing a dotgen component specification must have a `.gen`
extension. The description of the dotgen grammar uses a syntax notation that is
similar to `EBNF` (Extended Backus-Naur Format).  The following table lists the
symbols used in this format and their meaning.

|Symbol       | Meaning
|`::=`        | Definition

|`"text"`     | Terminals
|`( ... )`    | Grouping
|`{ ... }`    | Repetitions: may occur zero or any number of times
|`[ ... ]`    | Option: may occur zero or one time
