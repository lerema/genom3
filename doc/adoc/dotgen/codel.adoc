Codel declaration
-----------------




Codels are callbacks to the actual code implementing services in a
component. There are two kind of codels: `simple codels` and `finite state
machine codels`.

****
[horizontal]
(41) `*codel-property        ::=*` ::
   <<grammar#dotgen-rule-opt-async,`opt-async`>> `"codel"` `(` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-codel,`codel`>> `";"` +
                              `|` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-fsm-codel,`fsm-codel`>> `";"` `)`
(36) `*opt-async             ::=*` ::
   `[` `"async"` `]`
****

Codels are normally functions that execute in a short amount of time
compared to the time characteristics of the component. During the execution
of a codel, the component is typically blocked. If a codel is
expected to last much longer than the desired reaction time of the
component, or block until some external event arrives, it can be labelled
`async`.


=== Simple codels

Simple codels are functions associated to service validation callbacks or
implementing component `functions`.

****
[horizontal]
(34) `*codel                 ::=*` ::
   <<grammar#dotgen-rule-identifier,`identifier`>> `"("` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-codel-parameters,`codel-parameters`>> `")"`
****

The +identifier+ is the name of the external function implementing the
codel. +parameters+ are described in the third section.

=== Finite state machine codels

Finite state machine (FSM) codels are functions associated to the execution
of `activities`.

****
[horizontal]
(35) `*fsm-codel             ::=*` ::
   `"<"` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-event-list,`event-list`>> `">"` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-identifier,`identifier`>> `"("` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-codel-parameters,`codel-parameters`>> `")"` `"yields"` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-event-list,`event-list`>>
(38) `*event-list            ::=*` ::
   `{` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-event-name,`event-name`>> `","` `}` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-event-name,`event-name`>>
(37) `*event-name            ::=*` ::
   `[` `"pause"` `"::"` `]` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-identifier,`identifier`>>
****

In addition to the +identifier+ and +parameters+ described in the previous
section, FSM codels define the state machine of their corresponding
`activity`. The state machine is defined with a list of states and possible
transitions.

The bracketed +event list+, before the codel +identifier+ defines one (or
more) state of the FSM, and associates the codel with this state (or list of
states). When the FSM reaches the corresponding state, the codel is
executed. There are two predefined states : +start+ and +stop+. The +start+
state is required: this is the state in which the FSM begins its
execution. The +stop+ state is optional: the FSM goes into this state when
it receives an external interruption request.

The +event list+ specified after the `yield` keyword statically defines all
possible transitions from this state to other states. For each possible
transition, a corresponding state must exist in the activity FSM. There is
one predefined transition called +ether+: this is the final state of the FSM
and it is used to indicate the regular termination of the activity. There
must always exist a path from the +start+ state to the +ether+ state. If a
+stop+ state is defined, a path from +stop+ to +ether+ must also exist.
The actual transition executed by the FSM depends on the codel function
return value.

Transitions normally occur immediately, so that the FSM executes as fast as
possible. This execution can still be explicitely paused, for instance to
wait until the next period or until something new happens in the
component. For this purpose, a transition to a new state `s` can optionally
be defined in the `pause` namespace, by specifying the transition as
`pause::s`. A `paused` transition means that the FSM will pause its
execution either until the next period (within periodic tasks), or until a
new internal event occurs (within tasks with no period). Internal events
correspond to a +non-paused+ transition of another activity within the
component, or the execution of an `attribute` or `function`.

=== Example

This would declare a FSM with one +main+ state, typically looping until some
condition is met, and a stop state in case of premature interruption.

[source,C]
----
codel<start> do_start()            yield main;
codel<main>  do_main(in condition) yield pause::main, ether;
codel<stop>  do_stop()             yield ether;
----

In this example, the +main+ loop will be paced according to the context in
which the codels are defined (a periodic task, for instance). Without the
`paused` transition, the loop would typically eat all the available CPU.


=== Codel parameters

****
[horizontal]
(39) `*codel-parameters      ::=*` ::
   `[` `{` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-codel-parameter,`codel-parameter`>> `","` `}` <<grammar#dotgen-rule-codel-parameter,`codel-parameter`>> `]`
