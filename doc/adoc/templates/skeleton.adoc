Skeleton template
-----------------






The skeleton template generates the skeleton of the codel functions
defined in the input .gen file. It also generates a sample build
infrastructure for building them. By default, files are generated in the
same directory as the input .gen file. The `-C` option can be used to
specify another output directory.

The `+-l c+++` option is specific to `C` codels. It generates a skeleton
that compiles the codels with a `{cpp}` compiler. This is useful for
invoking `{cpp}` code from the codels (Note that this is different from
having `{cpp}` codels.)

Files generated with this template are freely modifiable (and are actually
required to be modified in order to provide some real codels). They are
provided only as a sample - yet sensible - implementation. The only
requirement is that codels provide a `pkg-config` file (`.pc`)
named `<component>-genom3.pc` and telling the other templates how to
link with the codels library.

The template can also be invoked in 'merge' mode, where it updates existing
skeletons. This mode tries to merge modifications in the .gen file, for
instance service addition or new interface definitions, into existing
codels. In case of conflicting files, there are several merge strategies:
option `-u` places conflicts markers in the source file, option `-i`
interactively asks what to do, and the generic option `-m tool` runs `tool`
on the conflicting files. `tool` can be any merge tool, for instance
`meld`.
