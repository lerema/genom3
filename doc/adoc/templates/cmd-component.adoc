== *$component* TCL engine command

Those commands manipulate components objects and return information about
them. They all take a compoent object as their first argument, noted
`$component` in the following command descriptions. Such an object is
typically returned by other procedures, such as
link:cmd-dotgen{outfilesuffix}#dotgen_components[`dotgen components`].

























































[[name]]
=== *$component name*

Return the name of the component as a string.






[[doc]]
=== *$component doc*

Return a string containing the documentation of the component defined
in the `doc` attributes of the `.gen` description.

[[version]]
=== *$component version*

Return a string containing the version of the component defined in
the `version` attribute of the `.gen` description.

[[lang]]
=== *$component lang*

Return a string containing the programming language of the component
codels defined in the `lang` attribute of the `.gen` description.

[[email]]
=== *$component email*

Return a string containing the maintainer e-mail of the component
defined in the `email` attribute of the `.gen` description.








[[clockrate]]
=== *$component clockrate*

Return a link:cmd-type{outfilesuffix}[numeric floating point constant]
representing the period of the internal component clock in
seconds. This is either the value defined in the `clock-rate`
attributes of the `.gen` description, or the greatest common divisor
of all the periods of periodic tasks if no `clock-rate` is defined. If
the component has no periodic tasks, this raises an error.

[[stack]]
=== *$component stack*

Return a link:cmd-type{outfilesuffix}[integer constant]
representing the minimum stack size of all tasks of the component.







[[ids]]
=== *$component ids*

Return the `ids` link:cmd-type{outfilesuffix}[`struct` type] of the
component.







[[require]]
=== *$component require*

Return a list of strings containing the requirement of the component
defined in the `require` attribute of the `.gen` description.

[[crequire]]
=== *$component codels-require*

Return a list of strings containing the requirement of the component
defined in the `codels-require` attribute of the `.gen` description.

















[[throws]]
=== *$component throws*

Return a list of link:cmd-type{outfilesuffix}[`exceptions`] possibly
raised by the commponent. This is the concatenation of all exceptions
defined in the component itself and its tasks and services.



















































[[tasks]]
=== *$component tasks*

Return the list of link:cmd-task{outfilesuffix}[tasks] defined in the
commponent.













[[ports]]
=== *$component ports* [[in|out|simple|multiple] ...]

Return the list of link:cmd-port{outfilesuffix}[ports] defined in the
commponent. The list may be filtered by a keyword described
below. Multiple keyword may be given: they are combined with an
implicit 'or'.

.Arguments
[horizontal]
'in':: Return the input ports.
'out':: Return the output ports.
'simple':: Return the ports that are not of kind `multiple`.
'multiple':: Return the ports that are of kind `multiple`.







[[services]]
=== *$component services*

Return the list of link:cmd-service{outfilesuffix}[services] defined
in the commponent.













[[remotes]]
=== *$component remotes*

Return the list of link:cmd-service{outfilesuffix}[remote services]
defined in the commponent.













[[codels]]
=== *$component codels* [[validate|simple|fsm] ...]

Return the list of link:cmd-codel{outfilesuffix}[codels] defined in
the commponent. The list may be filtered by a keyword described
below. Multiple keyword may be given: they are combined with an
implicit 'or'.

.Arguments
[horizontal]
'validate':: Return the validation codels.
'simple':: Return the simple codels of functions.
'fsm':: Return the codels associated with activities and a state
machine.

































































[[types]]
=== *$component types* ['visibility'] ['filter']

Return the list of link:cmd-type{outfilesuffix}[types] defined in the
commponent. The list may be filtered according to a particular
`visiblity` and a `filter` function.

.Arguments
[horizontal]
'visibility':: Must be one of `public`, `private` or `external`.
'public'::: Return the types that are used in services or ports and
are thus exposed to clients.
'private'::: Return the types that are only used internally in the
component and do not appear in any interface.
'external'::: Return the types that are used by remote services.

'filter'::
The optional filter can be used to filter out some elements from the
type list. The filter must be a tcl anonymous function (see tcl
`[apply]` command) that accepts one argument that is a genom
object. It  must return a boolean to indicate whether the type should
be included (true) or excluded (false).

[[digest]]
=== *$component digest* ['filter']

Return a string containing a MD5 hash of the commponent. The hash is
computed using relevant data of ports (name, kind, type) and services
(name, parameters direction and type). The list of objects used in the
hash may be filtered according to a particular `filter` function.

.Arguments
[horizontal]
'filter'::
The optional filter must be a tcl anonymous function (see tcl
`[apply]` command) that accepts one argument that is a genom
object. It  must return a boolean to indicate whether the object should
be included (true) or excluded (false) from the hash computation.




















[[loc]]
=== *$component loc* [file|line|column|context]

Return a list describing the source location where that component is
defined. The list contains four elements: the file name, the line
number, the column number and the original component context of the
definition. If an optional argument is given, only the corresponding
element is returned.







[[class]]
=== *$component class*

Always returns the string "component". Useful to determine at runtime
that the object is a component object.
