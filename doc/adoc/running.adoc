=== Generating the skeleton of the codels

TBD

The `configure` script generated by the `skeleton` template provides a way to
configure and compile several templates (including the component codels) in one
single step. This is usually more practical during the component development
phase, as it automatically prevents from forgetting to recompile some bits
after a modification in the component source. It also minimizes the number of
commands to type to compile and install a server and its client. This is done
by using the `--with-templates` option. It must be followed by a coma-separated
list of templates to generate (and configure, build and install). See the
link:tutorials/workflow{outfilesuffix}[workflow tutorial] for a practical
example.
