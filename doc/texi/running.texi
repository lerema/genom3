@genom{} is invoked by using one of the three following command lines:

@verbatim
genom3 [-l] [-h] [--version]
genom3 [-I dir] [-D macro[=value]] [-E|-n] [-v] [-d] file.gen
genom3 [general options] template [template options] file.gen
@end verbatim

The following sections give an overview of the general behaviour
(@pxref{Description}) and detail the options affecting the @genom{}
program itself (@pxref{General options}) as well as options that can
be passed to templates (@pxref{Template options}). A list of
recognized environment variables is also given (@pxref{Environment
variables}).

@menu
* Description::			@htmd General description
* General options::		@htmd Options for genom
* Template options::		@htmd Options for templates
* Environment variables::	@htmd Recognized environment variables
@end menu

@include genom-options.texi
