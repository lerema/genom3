			    Changes in genom 2.99.2

Released on June 27th, 2010

 . Developed the first draft of the C++ mappings.
   For bounded version of string and sequences, the mapping relies on a runtime
   header that contains a generic implementation of those types. For now, those
   structs provide no method, until we decide what is really needed. Unbounded
   strings and sequences use the STL string and vector types directly. Unions
   are mapped to a struct containing the discriminant plus a native union, but
   union members whose C++ mapping have a non-trivial constructor are not
   allowed. The other (basic) types have the same mapping as in C.

 . Make everything optional in a .gen file: it is up to a template to decide
   what is mandatory for it.

 . The 'throws' keyword was renamed to 'throw', for consistency with other
   keywords.

 . Implement the long long integers. Long long are 64 bits integers.

 . Make the C mapping use the C99 fixed size integer types.

 . Templates are now looked in a path (colon-separated list of directories).
   Added the GENOM_TMPL_PATH environment variable that can define (as for the
   -t option) this path. Added the default share/genom/site-template directory
   in the template search path, so that external templates can install in a
   location not dependent on GenoM version.

 . Interactive template accepts a -b (batch) option that disable line editing
   facility and is well suited for non-interactive use.

 . Improved a bit the regression tests. In particular, the C and C++ mappings
   for a set of complex IDL datatypes are compiled to check that the mapping at
   least generate code that has a meaning.

 . Add --version option to the genom tool.


			    Changes in genom 2.99.1

 Released on June 9th, 2010.

 . Started documentation. The full document is available in PDF, HTML or ascii
   text. It contains a detailed list of the dotgen (.gen) grammar rules; some
   of the most basic rules are explained. The genom command line tool usage is
   described (also available as a separate unix man page). Tcl template
   commands are extensively described.

 . Added a release() method in the C mapping for unbounded sequences. The code
   allocating some memory for the sequence is expected to update this pointer
   so that other parts of the code can possibly reallocate some storage.

 . Improved some TCL template commands. Parameters of a service can now be
   retrieved by filtering them on their nature (in, out, inout, port...).
   Same for the port list.

 . Added [template require] template procedure. It loads additional tcl source
   code that is made available to the template files.

 . Beautify code generation: two newline characters around <' ... '> markers in
   template files are replaced by only one newline. This handles the case where
   a whole line of template source consists only in TCL code: you naturally
   expect this line to be removed in the generated source.

 . Fixed error line reporting in template files, and improved error reporting
   verbosity in verbose (-v) mode.

 Released on March 26th, 2010.

 . First public version. This was released after the most basic design was
   achieved and has proven to be able to generate some code.
